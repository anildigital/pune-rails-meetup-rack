### It is 
* A Convention
* A SPEC, "Just" a document.
* A Interface, Contract, Agreement, Protocol, API
* Conventions for expressing HTTP in Ruby.
* A collection of middlewares
* Based on Python's WSGI.

### It is
* Interface for web applications servers to run and talk to web applications.

!SLIDE 
### GitHub page says
## Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called middleware) into a single method call. ###

# What is a Rack application?

!SLIDE
###A Rack application is an Ruby object (not a class) that responds to call. It takes exactly one argument, the environment and returns an Array of exactly three values: The status, the headers, and the body.###

## What Rack additionally provides

!SLIDE 
### Rack::Request, which also provides query string parsing and multipart handling 

!SLIDE 
### Rack::Response, for convenient generation of HTTP replies and cookie handling

!SLIDE
### Rack::MockRequest and Rack::MockResponse for efficient and quick testing of Rack application without real HTTP round-trips

!SLIDE
### Rack Handlers for different web servers. e.g. Rack::Handler::Thin.

!SLIDE 
### Rack::Builder, which implements a small DSL to iteratively construct Rack applications.

!SLIDE
### Rack::URLMap, an extremely easy way to combine different web applications with

!SLIDE
### Rack::CommonLogger, for creating Apache-style logfiles.

!SLIDE
### Rack::ShowException, for catching unhandled exceptions and presenting them in a nice and helpful way with clickable backtrace.

!SLIDE
### Rack::File, for serving static files.

!SLIDE 

### rackup, a useful tool for running Rack applications, which uses the Rack::Builder DSL to configure middleware and build up applications easily.

!SLIDE
### Middlewares, introduces a concept of middlewares, which is in between servers and applications.

# Basically

!SLIDE smbullets incremental
* for want of a better term, rack is "middleware" between servers and applications/frameworks), rack services a number of concerns
* server abstraction (handlers)
* request abstraction (server env -> hash) (happens in handlers, required by spec)
* response abstraction (tuples, by spec)
* utilities (Rack::Request, Rack::Response, Rack::Utils)
* common usage patterns (default middlewares)
* sane defaults (most handlers add Rack::ContentLength to the middleware stack)
* configuration convention (.ru files eval'd into Rack::Builder instances)
* quick development procedures (rackup)
